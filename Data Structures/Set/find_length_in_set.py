# Define a set of cat weights
cat_weights = {8, 10, 6, 12, 7}

# Calculate the length of the set
length_of_set = len(cat_weights)

# Display the results
print("Cat Weights Set:", cat_weights)
print("Length of the Cat Weights Set:", length_of_set)


'''
Output will be: 
Cat Weights Set: {6, 7, 8, 10, 12}
Length of the Cat Weights Set: 5

The length of the cat_weights set is 5, meaning there are five unique weights recorded. This could be a list of 
different weights for a group of cats, for example, in a cat shelter.
